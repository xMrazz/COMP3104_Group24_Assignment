Learning DevOps is important in making software because it helps 
teams work together better. DevOps engineers make sure that creating, testing, 
and releasing software happens smoothly and quickly. 
This makes the whole process faster, with fewer mistakes. 
When everyone in the team communicates and works well together, 
the software turns out better and is ready for users faster.
